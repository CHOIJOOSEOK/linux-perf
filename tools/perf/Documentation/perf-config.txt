perf-config(1)
==============

NAME
----
perf-config - Get and set variables in a configuration file.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf config' [<file-option>] [section.name ...]
or
'perf config' [<file-option>] -l | --list
or
'perf config' [<file-option>] -a | --list-all

DESCRIPTION
-----------
You can manage variables in a configuration file with this command.

OPTIONS
-------

-l::
--list::
	Show current config variables, name and value, for all sections.

--user::
	For writing and reading options: write to user
	'$HOME/.perfconfig' file or read it.

--system::
	For writing and reading options: write to system-wide
	'$(sysconfdir)/perfconfig' or read it.

-a::
--list-all::
	Show current and all possible config variables with default values.

CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

The perf configuration file contains many variables to change various
aspects of each of its tools, including output, disk usage, etc.
The '$HOME/.perfconfig' file is used to store a per-user configuration.
The file '$(sysconfdir)/perfconfig' can be used to
store a system-wide default configuration.

When reading or writing, the values are read from the system and user
configuration files by default, and options '--system' and '--user'
can be used to tell the command to read from or write to only that location.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The file consist of sections. A section starts with its name
surrounded by square brackets and continues till the next section
begins. Each variable must be in a section, and have the form
'name = value', for example:

	[section]
		name1 = value1
		name2 = value2

Section names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except
newline (double quote `"` and backslash have to be escaped as `\"` and `\\`,
respectively). Section headers can't span multiple lines.

Example
~~~~~~~

Given a $HOME/.perfconfig like this:

#
# This is the config file, and
# a '#' and ';' character indicates a comment
#

[colors]
	# Color variables
	top = red, default
	medium = green, default
	normal = lightgray, default
	selected = white, lightgray
	code = blue, default
	addr = magenta, default
	root = white, blue

[tui]
	# Defaults if linked with libslang
	report = on
	annotate = on
	top = on

[buildid]
	# Default, disable using /dev/null
	dir = ~/.debug

[annotate]
	# Defaults
	hide_src_code = false
	use_offset = true
	jump_arrows = true
	show_nr_jumps = false

[help]
	# Format can be man, info, web or html
	format = man
	autocorrect = 0

[ui]
	show-headers= true

[call-graph]
	# fp (framepointer), dwarf
	record-mode = fp
	print-type = graph
	order = caller
	sort-key = function

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

colors.*::
	The variables for customizing the colors used in the output for the
	'report', 'top' and annotate in the TUI. They should specify the
	background and foreground colors, separated by a comma, for example:

		medium = green, lightgray

	If you want to use the color configured for you terminal, just leave it
	as 'default', for example:

		medium = default, lightgray

	Available colors:
	red, green, default, black, blue, white, magenta, lightgray

	colors.top::
		'top' means a overhead percentage which is more than 5%.
		And values of this variable specify percentage colors.
		Basic key values are foreground-color 'red' and
		background-color 'default'.
	colors.medium::
		'medium' means a overhead percentage which has more than 0.5%.
		Default values are 'green' and 'default'.
	colors.normal::
		'normal' means the rest of overhead percentages
		except 'top', 'medium', 'selected'.
		Default values are 'lightgray' and 'default'.
	colors.selected::
		This selects the colors for the current entry in a list of entries
		from sub-commands (top,report,annotate).
		Default values are 'white' and 'lightgray'.
	colors.code::
		Colors for arrows and lines in jumps on  assembly code listings
		such as 'jns','jmp','jane',etc. Default values are 'blue', 'default'.
	colors.addr::
		This selects colors for addresses from 'annotate'.
		Default values are 'magenta', 'default'.
	colors.root::
		Colors for headers in the output of a sub-command 'top'.
		Default values are 'white', 'blue'.

tui.*, gtk.*::
	Available subcommands are 'top', 'report' and 'annotate'.
	These values are a boolean type, for example:

		top = true

	By setting value, TUI or GTK can be enabled or not. But it is needed
	that perf detects the required library for them during build.

buildid.*::
	buildid.dir::
		Each executable and shared library in modern distributions comes with a
		content based identifier that, if available, will be inserted in a
		'perf.data' file header to, at analysis time find what is needed to do
		symbol resolution, code annotation, etc.

		The recording tools also stores a hard link or copy in a per-user
		directory, $HOME/.debug/, of binaries, shared libraries, /proc/kallsyms
		and /proc/kcore files to be used at analysis time.

		The buildid.dir variable can be used to either change this directory
		cache location, or to disable it altogether. If you want to disable it,
		set buildid.dir to /dev/null. The default is $HOME/.debug

annotate.*::
	There're options which work with a 'annotate' sub-command.
	These are in control of addresses, jump function, source code
	in lines of assembly code from a specific program.

	annotate.hide_src_code::
		If a program which is analyzed has source code,
		this option lets 'annotate' print a list of assembly code with the source code.
		For example, let's see a part of a program. There're four lines.
		If this option is 'true', they can be printed
		without source code from a program as below.

		│        push   %rbp
		│        mov    %rsp,%rbp
		│        sub    $0x10,%rsp
		│        mov    (%rdi),%rdx

		But if this option is 'false', source code of the part
		can be also printed as below.

		│      struct rb_node *rb_next(const struct rb_node *node)
		│      {
		│        push   %rbp
		│        mov    %rsp,%rbp
		│        sub    $0x10,%rsp
		│              struct rb_node *parent;
		│
		│              if (RB_EMPTY_NODE(node))
		│        mov    (%rdi),%rdx
		│              return n;

        annotate.use_offset::
		Basing on a first address of a loaded function, offset can be used.
		Instead of using original addresses of assembly code,
		addresses subtracted from a base address can be printed.
		Let's illustrate a example.
		If a base address is 0XFFFFFFFF81624d50 as below,

		ffffffff81624d50 <load0>

		a address on assembly code has a specific absolute address as below

		ffffffff816250b8:│  mov    0x8(%r14),%rdi

		but if use_offset is 'true', a address subtracted from a base address is printed.
		The default is true. This option is only applied to TUI.

		             368:│  mov    0x8(%r14),%rdi

	annotate.jump_arrows::
		There can be jump instruction among assembly code.
		Depending on a boolean value of jump_arrows,
		arrows can be printed or not which represent
		where do the instruction jump into as below.

		│     ┌──jmp    1333
		│     │  xchg   %ax,%ax
		│1330:│  mov    %r15,%r10
		│1333:└─→cmp    %r15,%r14

		If jump_arrow is 'false', the arrows isn't printed as below.

		│      ↓ jmp    1333
		│        xchg   %ax,%ax
		│1330:   mov    %r15,%r10
		│1333:   cmp    %r15,%r14

        annotate.show_nr_jumps::
		Let's see a part of assembly code.

		│1382:   movb   $0x1,-0x270(%rbp)

		If use this, the number of branches branching to that address can be printed as below.

		│1 1382:   movb   $0x1,-0x270(%rbp)

help.*::
	help.format:: = man
		A format of manual page can be 'man', 'info', 'web' or 'html'.
		'man' is default.
	help.autocorrect:: = 0
		Automatically correct and execute mistyped commands after
		waiting for the given number of deciseconds (0.1 sec).
		Let's see a example. If a mistyped sub-command is executed like 'perf mistyped-command'
		and this option is 0, the output is as below.

		perf: 'mistyped-command' is not a perf-command. See 'perf --help'.

		Or if this option is more than 1, the output can be such as.

		WARNING: You called a perf program named 'mistyped-command', which does not exist.
		Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'with-kcore'
		in 0.1 seconds automatically...
		Usage: perf-with-kcore <perf sub-command> <perf.data directory> [<sub-command options> [ -- <workload>]]
		<perf sub-command> can be record, script, report or inject
		    or: perf-with-kcore fix_buildid_cache_permissions

hist.*::
	hist.percentage::
		This option control a way to calcurate overhead of filtered entries -
		that means the value of this option is effective only if there's a
		filter (by comm, dso or symbol name).  Suppose a following example:

		       Overhead  Symbols
		       ........  .......
		        33.33%     foo
		        33.33%     bar
		        33.33%     baz

	       This is an original overhead and we'll filter out the first 'foo'
	       entry.  The value of 'relative' would increase the overhead of 'bar'
	       and 'baz' to 50.00% for each, while 'absolute' would show their
	       current overhead (33.33%).

ui.*::
	ui.show-headers::
		There're columns as header 'Overhead', 'Children', 'Shared Object', 'Symbol', 'self'.
		If this option is false, they are hiden. This option is only applied to TUI.

call-graph.*::
	When sub-commands 'top' and 'report' work with -g/—-children
	there're options in control of call-graph.

	call-graph.record-mode::
		The record-mode can be 'fp' (frame pointer) and 'dwarf'.
		The value of 'dwarf' is effective only if perf detect needed library
		(libunwind or a recent version of libdw).  Also it doesn't *require*
		the dump-size option since it can use the default value of 8192 if
		missing.

	call-graph.dump-size::
		The size of stack to dump in order to do post-unwinding.  Default is 8192 (byte).
		When using dwarf into record-mode this option should have a value.

	call-graph.print-type::
		The print-types can be graph (graph absolute), fractal (graph relative), flat.
		This option controls a way to show overhead for each callchain entry.
		Suppose a following example.

		Overhead  Symbols
		........  .......
		  40.00%  foo
		      |
		      --- foo
		      |
		      |--50.00%-- bar
		      |           main
		      |
		      --50.00%-- baz
		                 main

		This output is a 'fractal' format. The 'foo' came from 'bar' and 'baz' exactly
		half and half so 'fractal' shows 50.00% for each
		(meaning that it assumes 100% total overhead of 'foo').

		The 'graph' uses absolute overhead value of 'foo' as total so each of
		'bar' and 'baz' callchain will have 20.00% of overhead.

	call-graph.order::
		This option controls print order of callchains. The default is
		'callee' which means callee is printed at top and then followed by its
		caller and so on.  The 'caller' prints it in reverse order.

		If this option is not set and report.children or top.children is
		set to true (or the equivalent command line option is given),
		the default value of this option is changed to 'caller' for the
		execution of 'perf report' or 'perf top'.  Other commands will
		still default to 'callee'.

	call-graph.sort-key::
		The callchains are merged if they contain same information.
		The sort-key option determines a way to compare the callchains.
		A value of 'sort-key' can be 'function' or 'address'.
		The default is 'function'.

	call-graph.threshold::
		When there're many callchains it'd print tons of lines.  So perf omits
		small callchains under a certain overhead (threshold) and this option
		control the threashold.  Default is 0.5 (%).

	call-graph.print-limit::
		This is another way to control the number of callchains printed for a
		single entry.  Default is 0 which means no limitation.

report.*::
	report.percent-limit::
		This one is mostly same as call-graph.threshold but works for
		histogram entries.  Entries have overhead lower than this percentage
		will not be printed.  Default is 0.
		If percent-limit is 70, the output which has percentages of
		each overhead above 70% can be printed.

	report.queue-size::
		option to setup the maximum allocation size for session's
		ordered events queue, if not set there's no default limit.

	report.children::
		The children means that functions called from another function.
		If the option is true, accumulate callchain of children and show total overhead.
		Please refer to the perf-report manual. The default is true.

top.*::
	top.children::
		This option means same as report.children. So it is true,
		the output of 'top' is rearranged by each overhead into children group.
		The default is true.

man.*::
	man.viewer::
		This option can assign a manual tool with which a subcommand 'help' work.
		it can used as 'man', 'woman', 'konqueror'. Default value is 'man'.

pager.*::
	pager.<subcommand>::
		When a subcommand work as stdio instead of TUI, use pager with it.
		Default value is 'true'.

kmem.*::
	kmem.default::
		This option can decide which allocator is analyzed between 'slab' and 'page'
		without using options '--slab' and '--page'.
		Default value is 'slab'.
